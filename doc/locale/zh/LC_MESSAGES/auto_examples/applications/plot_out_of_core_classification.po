"This is an example showing how scikit-learn can be used for "
"classification using an out-of-core approach: learning from data that "
"doesn't fit into main memory. We make use of an online classifier, i.e., "
"one that supports the partial_fit method, that will be fed with batches "
"of examples. To guarantee that the features space remains the same over "
"time we leverage a HashingVectorizer that will project each example into "
"the same feature space. This is especially useful in the case of text "
"classification where new features (words) may appear in each batch."

"The plot represents the learning curve of the classifier: the evolution "
"of classification accuracy over the course of the mini-batches. Accuracy "
"is measured on the first 1000 samples, held out as a validation set."
