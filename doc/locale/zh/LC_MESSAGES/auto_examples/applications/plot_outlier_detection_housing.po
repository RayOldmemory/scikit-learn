"This example illustrates the need for robust covariance estimation on a "
"real data set. It is useful both for outlier detection and for a better "
"understanding of the data structure."

"We selected two sets of two variables from the Boston housing data set as"
" an illustration of what kind of analysis can be done with several "
"outlier detection tools. For the purpose of visualization, we are working"
" with two-dimensional examples, but one should be aware that things are "
"not so trivial in high-dimension, as it will be pointed out."

"In both examples below, the main result is that the empirical covariance "
"estimate, as a non-robust one, is highly influenced by the heterogeneous "
"structure of the observations. Although the robust covariance estimate is"
" able to focus on the main mode of the data distribution, it sticks to "
"the assumption that the data should be Gaussian distributed, yielding "
"some biased estimation of the data structure, but yet accurate to some "
"extent. The One-Class SVM algorithm"

msgid ""
"The first example illustrates how robust covariance estimation can help "
"concentrating on a relevant cluster when another one exists. Here, many "
"observations are confounded into one and break down the empirical "
"covariance estimation. Of course, some screening tools would have pointed"
" out the presence of two clusters (Support Vector Machines, Gaussian "
"Mixture Models, univariate outlier detection, ...). But had it been a "
"high-dimensional example, none of these could be applied that easily."

msgstr ""

#: ../../auto_examples/applications/plot_outlier_detection_housing.rst:41
msgid ""
"The second example shows the ability of the Minimum Covariance "
"Determinant robust estimator of covariance to concentrate on the main "
"mode of the data distribution: the location seems to be well estimated, "
"although the covariance is hard to estimate due to the banana-shaped "
"distribution. Anyway, we can get rid of some outlying observations. The "
"One-Class SVM is able to capture the real data structure, but the "
"difficulty is to adjust its kernel bandwidth parameter so as to obtain a "
"good compromise between the shape of the data scatter matrix and the risk"
" of over-fitting the data."
