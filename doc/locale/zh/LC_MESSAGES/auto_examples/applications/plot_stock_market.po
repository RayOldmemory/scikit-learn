"This example employs several unsupervised learning techniques to extract "
"the stock market structure from variations in historical quotes."

"The quantity that we use is the daily variation in quote price: quotes "
"that are linked tend to cofluctuate during a day."

"We use sparse inverse covariance estimation to find which quotes are "
"correlated conditionally on the others. Specifically, sparse inverse "
"covariance gives us a graph, that is a list of connection. For each "
"symbol, the symbols that it is connected too are those useful to explain "
"its fluctuations."

"We use clustering to group together quotes that behave similarly. Here, "
"amongst the :ref:`various clustering techniques <clustering>` available "
"in the scikit-learn, we use :ref:`affinity_propagation` as it does not "
"enforce equal-size clusters, and it can choose automatically the number "
"of clusters from the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../auto_examples/applications/plot_stock_market.rst:36
msgid ""
"Note that this gives us a different indication than the graph, as the "
"graph reflects conditional relations between variables, while the "
"clustering reflects marginal properties: variables clustered together can"
" be considered as having a similar impact at the level of the full stock "
"market."
