"This example demonstrates the Spectral Co-clustering algorithm on the "
"twenty newsgroups dataset. The 'comp.os.ms-windows.misc' category is "
"excluded because it contains many posts containing nothing but data."

"The TF-IDF vectorized posts form a word frequency matrix, which is then "
"biclustered using Dhillon's Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. The "
"resulting document-word biclusters indicate subsets words used more often"
" in those subsets documents."

"For a few of the best biclusters, its most common document categories and"
" its ten most important words get printed. The best biclusters are "
"determined by their normalized cut. The best words are determined by "
"comparing their sums inside and outside the bicluster."

"For comparison, the documents are also clustered using MiniBatchKMeans. "
"The document clusters derived from the biclusters achieve a better "
"V-measure than clusters found by MiniBatchKMeans."
