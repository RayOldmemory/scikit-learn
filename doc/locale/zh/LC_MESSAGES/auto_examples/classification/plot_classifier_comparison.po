"A comparison of a several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic "
"datasets. The point of this example is to illustrate the nature of "
"decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a"
" grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these examples does not "
"necessarily carry over to real datasets."

"Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be "
"separated linearly and the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes "
"and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by "
"other classifiers."
