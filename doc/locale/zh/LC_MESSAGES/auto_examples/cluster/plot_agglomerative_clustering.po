"This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture"
" local structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest"

"Second, when using a connectivity matrix, average and complete linkage "
"are unstable and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. "
"Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by "
"considering all the distances between two clusters when merging them. The"
" connectivity graph breaks this mechanism. This effect is more pronounced"
" for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in "
"kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In particular, having a very"
" small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close"
" to that of single linkage, which is well known to have this percolation "
"instability."
