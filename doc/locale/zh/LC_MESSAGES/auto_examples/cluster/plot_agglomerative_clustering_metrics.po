"The example is engineered to show the effect of the choice of different "
"metrics. It is applied to waveforms, which can be seen as high-"
"dimensional vector. Indeed, the difference between metrics is usually "
"more pronounced in high dimension (in particular for euclidean and "
"cityblock)."

"We generate data from three groups of waveforms. Two of the waveforms "
"(waveform 1 and waveform 2) are proportional one to the other. The cosine"
" distance is invariant to a scaling of the data, as a result, it cannot "
"distinguish these two waveforms. Thus even with no noise, clustering "
"using this distance will not separate out waveform 1 and 2."

"We add observation noise to these waveforms. We generate very sparse "
"noise: only 6% of the time points contain noise. As a result, the l1 norm"
" of this noise (ie \"cityblock\" distance) is much smaller than it's l2 "
"norm (\"euclidean\" distance). This can be seen on the inter-class "
"distance matrices: the values on the diagonal, that characterize the "
"spread of the class, are much bigger for the Euclidean distance than for "
"the cityblock distance."

"When we apply clustering to the data, we find that the clustering "
"reflects what was in the distance matrices. Indeed, for the Euclidean "
"distance, the classes are ill-separated because of the noise, and thus "
"the clustering does not separate the waveforms. For the cityblock "
"distance, the separation is good and the waveform classes are recovered. "
"Finally, the cosine distance does not separate at all waveform 1 and 2, "
"thus the clustering puts them in the same cluster."
