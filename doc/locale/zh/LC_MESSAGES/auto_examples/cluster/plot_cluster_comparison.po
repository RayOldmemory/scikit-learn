"This example aims at showing characteristics of different clustering "
"algorithms on datasets that are \"interesting\" but still in 2D. The last"
" dataset is an example of a 'null' situation for clustering: the data is "
"homogeneous, and there is no good clustering."

"While these examples give some intuition about the algorithms, this "
"intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data."

"The results could be improved by tweaking the parameters for each "
"clustering strategy, for instance setting the number of clusters for the "
"methods that needs this parameter specified. Note that affinity "
"propagation has a tendency to create many clusters. Thus in this example "
"its two parameters (damping and per-point preference) were set to to "
"mitigate this behavior."
