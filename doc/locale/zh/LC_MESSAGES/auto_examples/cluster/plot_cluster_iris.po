"The plots display firstly what a K-means algorithm would yield using "
"three clusters. It is then shown what the effect of a bad initialization "
"is on the classification process: By setting n_init to only 1 (default is"
" 10), the amount of times that the algorithm will be run with different "
"centroid seeds is reduced. The next plot displays what using eight "
"clusters would deliver and finally the ground truth."
