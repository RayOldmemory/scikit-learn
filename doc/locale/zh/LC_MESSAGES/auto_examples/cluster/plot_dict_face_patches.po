"From the programming standpoint, it is interesting because it shows how "
"to use the online API of the scikit-learn to process a very large dataset"
" by chunks. The way we proceed is that we load an image at a time and "
"extract randomly 50 patches from this image. Once we have accumulated 500"
" of these patches (using 10 images), we run the `partial_fit` method of "
"the online KMeans object, MiniBatchKMeans."

msgid ""
"The verbose setting on the MiniBatchKMeans enables us to see that some "
"clusters are reassigned during the successive calls to partial-fit. This "
"is because the number of patches that they represent has become too low, "
"and it is better to choose a random new cluster."
