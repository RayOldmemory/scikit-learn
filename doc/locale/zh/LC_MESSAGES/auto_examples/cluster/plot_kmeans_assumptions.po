"This example is meant to illustrate situations where k-means will produce"
" unintuitive and possibly unexpected clusters. In the first three plots, "
"the input data does not conform to some implicit assumption that k-means "
"makes and undesirable clusters are produced as a result. In the last "
"plot, k-means returns intuitive clusters despite unevenly sized blobs."
