"In this example, an image with connected circles is generated and "
"spectral clustering is used to separate the circles."

msgid ""
"In these settings, the :ref:`spectral_clustering` approach solves the "
"problem know as 'normalized graph cuts': the image is seen as a graph of "
"connected voxels, and the spectral clustering algorithm amounts to "
"choosing graph cuts defining regions while minimizing the ratio of the "
"gradient along the cut, and the volume of the region."
msgstr ""

#: ../../auto_examples/cluster/plot_segmentation_toy.rst:19
msgid ""
"As the algorithm tries to balance the volume (ie balance the region "
"sizes), if we take circles with different sizes, the segmentation fails."
msgstr ""

#: ../../auto_examples/cluster/plot_segmentation_toy.rst:22
msgid ""
"In addition, as there is no useful information in the intensity of the "
"image, or its gradient, we choose to perform the spectral clustering on a"
" graph that is only weakly informed by the gradient. This is close to "
"performing a Voronoi partition of the graph."

"In addition, we use the mask of the objects to restrict the graph to the "
"outline of the objects. In this example, we are interested in separating "
"the objects one from the other, and not from the background."
