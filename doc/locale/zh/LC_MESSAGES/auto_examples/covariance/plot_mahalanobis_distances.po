"For Gaussian distributed data, the distance of an observation :math:`x_i`"
" to the mode of the distribution can be computed using its Mahalanobis "
"distance: :math:`d_{(\\mu,\\Sigma)}(x_i)^2 = (x_i - "
"\\mu)'\\Sigma^{-1}(x_i - \\mu)` where :math:`\\mu` and :math:`\\Sigma` "
"are the location and the covariance of the underlying Gaussian "
"distribution."

msgid ""
"In practice, :math:`\\mu` and :math:`\\Sigma` are replaced by some "
"estimates.  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate is very "
"sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data set and therefor, the "
"corresponding Mahalanobis distances are. One would better have to use a "
"robust estimator of covariance to guarantee that the estimation is "
"resistant to \"erroneous\" observations in the data set and that the "
"associated Mahalanobis distances accurately reflect the true organisation"
" of the observations."

"The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator is a robust, high-breakdown "
"point (i.e. it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of highly "
"contaminated datasets, up to "
":math:`\\frac{n_\\text{samples}-n_\\text{features}-1}{2}` outliers) "
"estimator of covariance. The idea is to find "
":math:`\\frac{n_\\text{samples}+n_\\text{features}+1}{2}` observations "
"whose empirical covariance has the smallest determinant, yielding a "
"\"pure\" subset of observations from which to compute standards estimates"
" of location and covariance."

"This example illustrates how the Mahalanobis distances are affected by "
"outlying data: observations drawn from a contaminating distribution are "
"not distinguishable from the observations coming from the real, Gaussian "
"distribution that one may want to work with. Using MCD-based Mahalanobis "
"distances, the two populations become distinguishable. Associated "
"applications are outliers detection, observations ranking, clustering, "
"... For visualization purpose, the cubic root of the Mahalanobis "
"distances are represented in the boxplot, as Wilson and Hilferty suggest "
