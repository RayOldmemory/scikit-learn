"The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate is very sensitive to the"
" presence of outliers in the data set. In such a case, it would be better"
" to use a robust estimator of covariance to guarantee that the estimation"
" is resistant to \"erroneous\" observations in the data set."

"The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator is a robust, high-breakdown "
"point (i.e. it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of highly "
"contaminated datasets, up to :math:`\\frac{n_\\text{samples} - "
"n_\\text{features}-1}{2}` outliers) estimator of covariance. The idea is "
"to find :math:`\\frac{n_\\text{samples} + n_\\text{features}+1}{2}` "
"observations whose empirical covariance has the smallest determinant, "
"yielding a \"pure\" subset of observations from which to compute "
"standards estimates of location and covariance. After a correction step "
"aiming at compensating the fact that the estimates were learned from only"
" a portion of the initial data, we end up with robust estimates of the "
"data set location and covariance."
