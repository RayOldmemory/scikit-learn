"Using the GraphLasso estimator to learn a covariance and sparse precision"
" from a small number of samples."

"To estimate a probabilistic model (e.g. a Gaussian model), estimating the"
" precision matrix, that is the inverse covariance matrix, is as important"
" as estimating the covariance matrix. Indeed a Gaussian model is "
"parametrized by the precision matrix."

"To be in favorable recovery conditions, we sample the data from a model "
"with a sparse inverse covariance matrix. In addition, we ensure that the "
"data is not too much correlated (limiting the largest coefficient of the "
"precision matrix) and that there a no small coefficients in the precision"
" matrix that cannot be recovered. In addition, with a small number of "
"observations, it is easier to recover a correlation matrix rather than a "
"covariance, thus we scale the time series."

"Here, the number of samples is slightly larger than the number of "
"dimensions, thus the empirical covariance is still invertible. However, "
"as the observations are strongly correlated, the empirical covariance "
"matrix is ill-conditioned and as a result its inverse --the empirical "
"precision matrix-- is very far from the ground truth."

"If we use l2 shrinkage, as with the Ledoit-Wolf estimator, as the number "
"of samples is small, we need to shrink a lot. As a result, the Ledoit-"
"Wolf precision is fairly close to the ground truth precision, that is not"
" far from being diagonal, but the off-diagonal structure is lost."

"The l1-penalized estimator can recover part of this off-diagonal "
"structure. It learns a sparse precision. It is not able to recover the "
"exact sparsity pattern: it detects too many non-zero coefficients. "
"However, the highest non-zero coefficients of the l1 estimated correspond"
" to the non-zero coefficients in the ground truth. Finally, the "
"coefficients of the l1 precision estimate are biased toward zero: because"
" of the penalty, they are all smaller than the corresponding ground truth"
" value, as can be seen on the figure."

"The alpha parameter of the GraphLasso setting the sparsity of the model "
"is set by internal cross-validation in the GraphLassoCV. As can be seen "
"on figure 2, the grid to compute the cross-validation score is "
"iteratively refined in the neighborhood of the maximum."
