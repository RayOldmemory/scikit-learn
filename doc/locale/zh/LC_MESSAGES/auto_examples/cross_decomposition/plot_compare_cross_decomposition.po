"Given 2 multivariate covarying two-dimensional datasets, X, and Y, PLS "
"extracts the 'directions of covariance', i.e. the components of each "
"datasets that explain the most shared variance between both datasets. "
"This is apparent on the **scatterplot matrix** display: components 1 in "
"dataset X and dataset Y are maximally correlated (points lie around the "
"first diagonal). This is also true for components 2 in both dataset, "
"however, the correlation across datasets for different components is "
"weak: the point cloud is very spherical."
