"Probabilistic PCA and Factor Analysis are probabilistic models. The "
"consequence is that the likelihood of new data can be used for model "
"selection and covariance estimation. Here we compare PCA and FA with "
"cross-validation on low rank data corrupted with homoscedastic noise "
"(noise variance is the same for each feature) or heteroscedastic noise "
"(noise variance is the different for each feature). In a second step we "
"compare the model likelihood to the likelihoods obtained from shrinkage "
"covariance estimators."

"One can observe that with homoscedastic noise both FA and PCA succeed in "
"recovering the size of the low rank subspace. The likelihood with PCA is "
"higher than FA in this case. However PCA fails and overestimates the rank"
" when heteroscedastic noise is present. Under appropriate circumstances "
"the low rank models are more likely than shrinkage models."
