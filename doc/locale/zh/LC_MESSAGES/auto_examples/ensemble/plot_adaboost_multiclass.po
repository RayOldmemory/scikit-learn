"This example reproduces Figure 1 of Zhu et al [1] and shows how boosting "
"can improve prediction accuracy on a multi-class problem. The "
"classification dataset is constructed by taking a ten-dimensional "
"standard normal distribution and defining three classes separated by "
"nested concentric ten-dimensional spheres such that roughly equal numbers"
" of samples are in each class (quantiles of the :math:`\\chi^2` "
"distribution)."

"The performance of the SAMME and SAMME.R [1] algorithms are compared. "
"SAMME.R uses the probability estimates to update the additive model, "
"while SAMME  uses the classifications only. As the example illustrates, "
"the SAMME.R algorithm typically converges faster than SAMME, achieving a "
"lower test error with fewer boosting iterations. The error of each "
"algorithm on the test set after each boosting iteration is shown on the "
"left, the classification error on the test set of each tree is shown in "
"the middle, and the boost weight of each tree is shown on the right. All "
"trees have a weight of one in the SAMME.R algorithm and therefore are not"
" shown."
