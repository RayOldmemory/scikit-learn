"This example fits an AdaBoosted decision stump on a non-linearly "
"separable classification dataset composed of two \"Gaussian quantiles\" "
"clusters (see :func:`sklearn.datasets.make_gaussian_quantiles`) and plots"
" the decision boundary and decision scores. The distributions of decision"
" scores are shown separately for samples of class A and B. The predicted "
"class label for each sample is determined by the sign of the decision "
"score. Samples with decision scores greater than zero are classified as "
"B, and are otherwise classified as A. The magnitude of a decision score "
"determines the degree of likeness with the predicted class label. "
"Additionally, a new dataset could be constructed containing a desired "
"purity of class B, for example, by only selecting samples with a decision"
" score above some value."
