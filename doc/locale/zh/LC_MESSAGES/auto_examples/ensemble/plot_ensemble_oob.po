"The ``RandomForestClassifier`` is trained using *bootstrap aggregation*, "
"where each new tree is fit from a bootstrap sample of the training "
"observations :math:`z_i = (x_i, y_i)`. The *out-of-bag* (OOB) error is "
"the average error for each :math:`z_i` calculated using predictions from "
"the trees that do not contain :math:`z_i` in their respective bootstrap "
"sample. This allows the ``RandomForestClassifier`` to be fit and "
"validated whilst being trained [1]."

"The example below demonstrates how the OOB error can be measured at the "
"addition of each new tree during training. The resulting plot allows a "
"practitioner to approximate a suitable value of ``n_estimators`` at which"
" the error stabilizes."
