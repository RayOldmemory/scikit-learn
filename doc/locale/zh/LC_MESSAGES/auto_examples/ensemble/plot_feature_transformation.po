"First fit an ensemble of trees (totally random trees, a random forest, or"
" gradient boosted trees) on the training set. Then each leaf of each tree"
" in the ensemble is assigned a fixed arbitrary feature index in a new "
"feature space. These leaf indices are then encoded in a one-hot fashion."

"Each sample goes through the decisions of each tree of the ensemble and "
"ends up in one leaf per tree. The sample is encoded by setting feature "
"values for these leaves to 1 and the other feature values to 0."
