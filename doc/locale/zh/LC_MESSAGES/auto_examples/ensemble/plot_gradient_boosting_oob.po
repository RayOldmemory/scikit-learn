"Out-of-bag (OOB) estimates can be a useful heuristic to estimate the "
"\"optimal\" number of boosting iterations. OOB estimates are almost "
"identical to cross-validation estimates but they can be computed on-the-"
"fly without the need for repeated model fitting. OOB estimates are only "
"available for Stochastic Gradient Boosting (i.e. ``subsample < 1.0``), "
"the estimates are derived from the improvement in loss based on the "
"examples not included in the bootstrap sample (the so-called out-of-bag "
"examples). The OOB estimator is a pessimistic estimator of the true test "
"loss, but remains a fairly good approximation for a small number of "
"trees."

"The figure shows the cumulative sum of the negative OOB improvements as a"
" function of the boosting iteration. As you can see, it tracks the test "
"loss for the first hundred iterations but then diverges in a pessimistic "
"way. The figure also shows the performance of 3-fold cross validation "
"which usually gives a better estimate of the test loss but is "
"computationally more demanding."
