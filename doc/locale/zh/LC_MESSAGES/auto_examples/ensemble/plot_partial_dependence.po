"Partial dependence plots show the dependence between the target function "
"[2]_ and a set of 'target' features, marginalizing over the values of all"
" other features (the complement features). Due to the limits of human "
"perception the size of the target feature set must be small (usually, one"
" or two) thus the target features are usually chosen among the most "
"important features (see "
":attr:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.feature_importances_`)."

"This example shows how to obtain partial dependence plots from a "
":class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` trained on the "
"California housing dataset. The example is taken from [1]_."

"The plot shows four one-way and one two-way partial dependence plots. The"
" target variables for the one-way PDP are: median income (`MedInc`), avg."
" occupants per household (`AvgOccup`), median house age (`HouseAge`), and"
" avg. rooms per household (`AveRooms`)."

"We can clearly see that the median house price shows a linear "
"relationship with the median income (top left) and that the house price "
"drops when the avg. occupants per household increases (top middle). The "
"top right plot shows that the house age in a district does not have a "
"strong influence on the (median) house price; so does the average rooms "
"per household. The tick marks on the x-axis represent the deciles of the "
"feature values in the training data."

"Partial dependence plots with two target features enable us to visualize "
"interactions among them. The two-way partial dependence plot shows the "
"dependence of median house price on joint values of house age and avg. "
"occupants per household. We can clearly see an interaction between the "
"two features: For an avg. occupancy greater than two, the house price is "
"nearly independent of the house age, whereas for values less than two "
"there is a strong dependence on age."
