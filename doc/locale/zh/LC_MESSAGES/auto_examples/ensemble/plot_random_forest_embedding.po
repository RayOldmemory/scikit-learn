"RandomTreesEmbedding provides a way to map data to a very high-"
"dimensional, sparse representation, which might be beneficial for "
"classification. The mapping is completely unsupervised and very "
"efficient."

"This example visualizes the partitions given by several trees and shows "
"how the transformation can also be used for non-linear dimensionality "
"reduction or non-linear classification."

msgid ""
"Points that are neighboring often share the same leaf of a tree and "
"therefore share large parts of their hashed representation. This allows "
"to separate two concentric circles simply based on the principal "
"components of the transformed data."

msgid ""
"In high-dimensional spaces, linear classifiers often achieve excellent "
"accuracy. For sparse binary data, BernoulliNB is particularly well-"
"suited. The bottom row compares the decision boundary obtained by "
"BernoulliNB in the transformed space with an ExtraTreesClassifier forests"
" learned on the original data."
