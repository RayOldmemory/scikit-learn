"First, three examplary classifiers are initialized (`LogisticRegression`,"
" `GaussianNB`, and `RandomForestClassifier`) and used to initialize a "
"soft-voting `VotingClassifier` with weights `[1, 1, 5]`, which means that"
" the predicted probabilities of the `RandomForestClassifier` count 5 "
"times as much as the weights of the other classifiers when the averaged "
"probability is calculated."

"To visualize the probability weighting, we fit each classifier on the "
"training set and plot the predicted class probabilities for the first "
