"Noisy (non informative) features are added to the iris data and "
"univariate feature selection is applied. For each feature, we plot the "
"p-values for the univariate feature selection and the corresponding "
"weights of an SVM. We can see that univariate feature selection selects "
"the informative features and that these have larger SVM weights."

"In the total set of features, only the 4 first ones are significant. We "
"can see that they have the highest score with univariate feature "
"selection. The SVM assigns a large weight to one of these features, but "
"also Selects many of the non-informative features. Applying univariate "
"feature selection before the SVM increases the SVM weight attributed to "
"the significant features, and will thus improve classification."
