"Compared to the OLS (ordinary least squares) estimator, the Theil-Sen "
"estimator is robust against outliers. It has a breakdown point of about "
"29.3% in case of a simple linear regression which means that it can "
"tolerate arbitrary corrupted data (outliers) of up to 29.3% in the two-"
"dimensional case."

"The estimation of the model is done by calculating the slopes and "
"intercepts of a subpopulation of all possible combinations of p subsample"
" points. If an intercept is fitted, p must be greater than or equal to "
"n_features + 1. The final slope and intercept is then defined as the "
"spatial median of these slopes and intercepts."

"In certain cases Theil-Sen performs better than :ref:`RANSAC "
"<ransac_regression>` which is also a robust method. This is illustrated "
"in the second example below where outliers with respect to the x-axis "
"perturb RANSAC. Tuning the ``residual_threshold`` parameter of RANSAC "
"remedies this but in general a priori knowledge about the data and the "
"nature of the outliers is needed. Due to the computational complexity of "
"Theil-Sen it is recommended to use it only for small problems in terms of"
" number of samples and features. For larger problems the "
"``max_subpopulation`` parameter restricts the magnitude of all possible "
"combinations of p subsample points to a randomly chosen subset and "
"therefore also limits the runtime. Therefore, Theil-Sen is applicable to "
"larger problems with the drawback of losing some of its mathematical "
"properties since it then works on a random subset."
