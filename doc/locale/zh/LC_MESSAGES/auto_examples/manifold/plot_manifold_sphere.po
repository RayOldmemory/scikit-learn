"An application of the different :ref:`manifold` techniques on a spherical"
" data-set. Here one can see the use of dimensionality reduction in order "
"to gain some intuition regarding the manifold learning methods. Regarding"
" the dataset, the poles are cut from the sphere, as well as a thin slice "
"down its side. This enables the manifold learning techniques to 'spread "
"it open' whilst projecting it onto two dimensions."

"Note that the purpose of the :ref:`MDS <multidimensional_scaling>` is to "
"find a low-dimensional representation of the data (here 2D) in which the "
"distances respect well the distances in the original high-dimensional "
"space, unlike other manifold-learning algorithms, it does not seeks an "
"isotropic representation of the data in the low-dimensional space. Here "
"the manifold problem matches fairly that of representing a flat map of "
"the Earth, as with `map projection "
