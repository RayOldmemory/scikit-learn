"Both models have access to five components with which to fit the data. "
"Note that the EM model will necessarily use all five components while the"
" DP model will effectively only use as many as are needed for a good fit."
" This is a property of the Dirichlet Process prior. Here we can see that "
"the EM model splits some components arbitrarily, because it is trying to "
"fit too many components, while the Dirichlet Process model adapts it "
"number of state automatically."

"This example doesn't show it, as we're in a low-dimensional space, but "
"another advantage of the Dirichlet process model is that it can fit full "
"covariance matrices effectively even when there are less examples per "
"cluster than there are dimensions in the data, due to regularization "
"properties of the inference algorithm."
