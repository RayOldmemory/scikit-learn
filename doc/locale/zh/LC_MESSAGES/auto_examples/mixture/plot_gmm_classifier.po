"Compares GMMs with spherical, diagonal, full, and tied covariance "
"matrices in increasing order of performance.  Although one would expect "
"full covariance to perform best in general, it is prone to overfitting on"
" small datasets and does not generalize well to held out test data."

"On the plots, train data is shown as dots, while test data is shown as "
"crosses. The iris dataset is four-dimensional. Only the first two "
"dimensions are shown here, and thus some points are separated in other "
"dimensions."
