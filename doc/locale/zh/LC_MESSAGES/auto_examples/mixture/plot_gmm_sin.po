"This example highlights the advantages of the Dirichlet Process: "
"complexity control and dealing with sparse data. The dataset is formed by"
" 100 points loosely spaced following a noisy sine curve. The fit by the "
"GMM class, using the expectation-maximization algorithm to fit a mixture "
"of 10 Gaussian components, finds too-small components and very little "
"structure. The fits by the Dirichlet process, however, show that the "
"model can either learn a global structure for the data (small alpha) or "
"easily interpolate to finding relevant local structure (large alpha), "
"never falling into the problems shown by the GMM class."
