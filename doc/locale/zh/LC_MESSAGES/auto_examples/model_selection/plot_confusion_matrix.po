"Example of confusion matrix usage to evaluate the quality of the output "
"of a classifier on the iris data set. The diagonal elements represent the"
" number of points for which the predicted label is equal to the true "
"label, while off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the "
"classifier. The higher the diagonal values of the confusion matrix the "
"better, indicating many correct predictions."

"The figures show the confusion matrix with and without normalization by "
"class support size (number of elements in each class). This kind of "
"normalization can be interesting in case of class imbalance to have a "
"more visual interpretation of which class is being misclassified."

"Here the results are not as good as they could be as our choice for the "
"regularization parameter C was not the best. In real life applications "
"this parameter is usually chosen using :ref:`grid_search`."
