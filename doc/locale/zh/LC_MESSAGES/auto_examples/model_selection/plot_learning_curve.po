"On the left side the learning curve of a naive Bayes classifier is shown "
"for the digits dataset. Note that the training score and the cross-"
"validation score are both not very good at the end. However, the shape of"
" the curve can be found in more complex datasets very often: the training"
" score is very high at the beginning and decreases and the cross-"
"validation score is very low at the beginning and increases. On the right"
" side we see the learning curve of an SVM with RBF kernel. We can see "
"clearly that the training score is still around the maximum and the "
"validation score could be increased with more training samples."
