"Example of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metric to evaluate "
"classifier output quality."

"ROC curves typically feature true positive rate on the Y axis, and false "
"positive rate on the X axis. This means that the top left corner of the "
"plot is the \"ideal\" point - a false positive rate of zero, and a true "
"positive rate of one. This is not very realistic, but it does mean that a"
" larger area under the curve (AUC) is usually better."

#: ../../auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.rst:19
msgid ""
"The \"steepness\" of ROC curves is also important, since it is ideal to "
"maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate."

"ROC curves are typically used in binary classification to study the "
"output of a classifier. In order to extend ROC curve and ROC area to "
"multi-class or multi-label classification, it is necessary to binarize "
"the output. One ROC curve can be drawn per label, but one can also draw a"
" ROC curve by considering each element of the label indicator matrix as a"
" binary prediction (micro-averaging)."

"Another evaluation measure for multi-class classification is macro-"
"averaging, which gives equal weight to the classification of each label."
