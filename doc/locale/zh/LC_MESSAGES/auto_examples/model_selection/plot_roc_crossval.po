"ROC curves typically feature true positive rate on the Y axis, and false "
"positive rate on the X axis. This means that the top left corner of the "
"plot is the \"ideal\" point - a false positive rate of zero, and a true "
"positive rate of one. This is not very realistic, but it does mean that a"
" larger area under the curve (AUC) is usually better."

"The \"steepness\" of ROC curves is also important, since it is ideal to "
"maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate."

"This example shows the ROC response of different datasets, created from "
"K-fold cross-validation. Taking all of these curves, it is possible to "
"calculate the mean area under curve, and see the variance of the curve "
"when the training set is split into different subsets. This roughly shows"
" how the classifier output is affected by changes in the training data, "
"and how different the splits generated by K-fold cross-validation are "
"from one another."
