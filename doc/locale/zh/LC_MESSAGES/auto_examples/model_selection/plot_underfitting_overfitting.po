"This example demonstrates the problems of underfitting and overfitting "
"and how we can use linear regression with polynomial features to "
"approximate nonlinear functions. The plot shows the function that we want"
" to approximate, which is a part of the cosine function. In addition, the"
" samples from the real function and the approximations of different "
"models are displayed. The models have polynomial features of different "
"degrees. We can see that a linear function (polynomial with degree 1) is "
"not sufficient to fit the training samples. This is called "
"**underfitting**. A polynomial of degree 4 approximates the true function"
" almost perfectly. However, for higher degrees the model will **overfit**"
" the training data, i.e. it learns the noise of the training data. We "
"evaluate quantitatively **overfitting** / **underfitting** by using "
"cross-validation. We calculate the mean squared error (MSE) on the "
"validation set, the higher, the less likely the model generalizes "
"correctly from the training data."
