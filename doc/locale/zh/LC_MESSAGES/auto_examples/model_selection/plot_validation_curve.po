"In this plot you can see the training scores and validation scores of an "
"SVM for different values of the kernel parameter gamma. For very low "
"values of gamma, you can see that both the training score and the "
"validation score are low. This is called underfitting. Medium values of "
"gamma will result in high values for both scores, i.e. the classifier is "
"performing fairly well. If gamma is too high, the classifier will "
"overfit, which means that the training score is good but the validation "
"score is poor."
