"Compare randomized search and grid search for optimizing hyperparameters "
"of a random forest. All parameters that influence the learning are "
"searched simultaneously (except for the number of estimators, which poses"
" a time / quality tradeoff)."

"The randomized search and the grid search explore exactly the same space "
"of parameters. The result in parameter settings is quite similar, while "
"the run time for randomized search is drastically lower."

"The performance is slightly worse for the randomized search, though this "
"is most likely a noise effect and would not carry over to a held-out test"
" set."

"Note that in practice, one would not search over this many different "
"parameters simultaneously using grid search, but pick only the ones "
"deemed most important."
