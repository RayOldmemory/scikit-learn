"This example demonstrates the behaviour of the accuracy of the nearest "
"neighbor queries of Locality Sensitive Hashing Forest as the number of "
"candidates and the number of estimators (trees) vary."

"In the first plot, accuracy is measured with the number of candidates. "
"Here, the term \"number of candidates\" refers to maximum bound for the "
"number of distinct points retrieved from each tree to calculate the "
"distances. Nearest neighbors are selected from this pool of candidates. "
"Number of estimators is maintained at three fixed levels (1, 5, 10)."

"In the second plot, the number of candidates is fixed at 50. Number of "
"trees is varied and the accuracy is plotted against those values. To "
"measure the accuracy, the true nearest neighbors are required, therefore "
":class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` is used to compute the exact "
"neighbors."
