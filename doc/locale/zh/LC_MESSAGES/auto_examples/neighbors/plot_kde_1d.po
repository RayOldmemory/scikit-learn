"The first plot shows one of the problems with using histograms to "
"visualize the density of points in 1D. Intuitively, a histogram can be "
"thought of as a scheme in which a unit \"block\" is stacked above each "
"point on a regular grid. As the top two panels show, however, the choice "
"of gridding for these blocks can lead to wildly divergent ideas about the"
" underlying shape of the density distribution.  If we instead center each"
" block on the point it represents, we get the estimate shown in the "
"bottom left panel.  This is a kernel density estimation with a \"top "
"hat\" kernel.  This idea can be generalized to other kernel shapes: the "
"bottom-right panel of the first figure shows a Gaussian kernel density "
"estimate over the same distribution."

"Scikit-learn implements efficient kernel density estimation using either "
"a Ball Tree or KD Tree structure, through the "
":class:`sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity` estimator.  The available "
"kernels are shown in the second figure of this example."

"The third figure compares kernel density estimates for a distribution of "
"100 samples in 1 dimension.  Though this example uses 1D distributions, "
"kernel density estimation is easily and efficiently extensible to higher "
"dimensions as well."
