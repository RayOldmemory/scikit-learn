"For greyscale image data where pixel values can be interpreted as degrees"
" of blackness on a white background, like handwritten digit recognition, "
"the Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann machine model (:class:`BernoulliRBM "
"<sklearn.neural_network.BernoulliRBM>`) can perform effective non-linear "
"feature extraction."

"In order to learn good latent representations from a small dataset, we "
"artificially generate more labeled data by perturbing the training data "
"with linear shifts of 1 pixel in each direction."

"This example shows how to build a classification pipeline with a "
"BernoulliRBM feature extractor and a :class:`LogisticRegression "
"<sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression>` classifier. The "
"hyperparameters of the entire model (learning rate, hidden layer size, "
"regularization) were optimized by grid search, but the search is not "
"reproduced here because of runtime constraints."

"Logistic regression on raw pixel values is presented for comparison. The "
"example shows that the features extracted by the BernoulliRBM help "
