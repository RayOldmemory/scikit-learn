"This example simulates a multi-label document classification problem. The"
" dataset is generated randomly based on the following process:"

"In the above process, rejection sampling is used to make sure that n is "
"more than 2, and that the document length is never zero. Likewise, we "
"reject classes which have already been chosen.  The documents that are "
"assigned to both classes are plotted surrounded by two colored circles."

"The classification is performed by projecting to the first two principal "
"components found by PCA and CCA for visualisation purposes, followed by "
"using the :class:`sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier` metaclassifier "
"using two SVCs with linear kernels to learn a discriminative model for "
"each class. Note that PCA is used to perform an unsupervised "
"dimensionality reduction, while CCA is used to perform a supervised one."

"Note: in the plot, \"unlabeled samples\" does not mean that we don't know"
" the labels (as in semi-supervised learning) but that the samples simply "
"do *not* have a label."
