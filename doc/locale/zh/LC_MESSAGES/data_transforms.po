"scikit-learn provides a library of transformers, which may clean (see "
":ref:`preprocessing`), reduce (see :ref:`data_reduction`), expand (see "
":ref:`kernel_approximation`) or generate (see :ref:`feature_extraction`) "
"feature representations."

"Like other estimators, these are represented by classes with ``fit`` "
"method, which learns model parameters (e.g. mean and standard deviation "
"for normalization) from a training set, and a ``transform`` method which "
"applies this transformation model to unseen data. ``fit_transform`` may "
"be more convenient and efficient for modelling and transforming the "
"training data simultaneously."

"Combining such transformers, either in parallel or series is covered in "
":ref:`combining_estimators`. :ref:`metrics` covers transforming feature "
"spaces into affinity matrices, while :ref:`preprocessing_targets` "
"considers transformations of the target space (e.g. categorical labels) "
"for use in scikit-learn."
