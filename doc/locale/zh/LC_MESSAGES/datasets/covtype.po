"The samples in this dataset correspond to 30Ã—30m patches of forest in the"
" US, collected for the task of predicting each patch's cover type, i.e. "
"the dominant species of tree. There are seven covertypes, making this a "
"multiclass classification problem. Each sample has 54 features, described"
" on the `dataset's homepage "
"<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype>`_. Some of the "
"features are boolean indicators, while others are discrete or continuous "
"measurements."

":func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_covtype` will load the covertype dataset; "
"it returns a dictionary-like object with the feature matrix in the "
"``data`` member and the target values in ``target``. The dataset will be "
"downloaded from the web if necessary."
