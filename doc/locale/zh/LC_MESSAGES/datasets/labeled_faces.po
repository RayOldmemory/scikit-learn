"Each picture is centered on a single face. The typical task is called "
"Face Verification: given a pair of two pictures, a binary classifier must"
" predict whether the two images are from the same person."

"An alternative task, Face Recognition or Face Identification is: given "
"the picture of the face of an unknown person, identify the name of the "
"person by referring to a gallery of previously seen pictures of "
"identified persons."

#: ../../datasets/labeled_faces.rst:20

"Both Face Verification and Face Recognition are tasks that are typically "
"performed on the output of a model trained to perform Face Detection. The"
" most popular model for Face Detection is called Viola-Jones and is "
"implemented in the OpenCV library. The LFW faces were extracted by this "
"face detector from various online websites."

msgid ""
"``scikit-learn`` provides two loaders that will automatically download, "
"cache, parse the metadata files, decode the jpeg and convert the "
"interesting slices into memmaped numpy arrays. This dataset size is more "
"than 200 MB. The first load typically takes more than a couple of minutes"
" to fully decode the relevant part of the JPEG files into numpy arrays. "
"If the dataset has  been loaded once, the following times the loading "
"times less than 200ms by using a memmaped version memoized on the disk in"
" the ``~/scikit_learn_data/lfw_home/`` folder using ``joblib``."

"Both for the :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people` and "
":func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs` function it is possible to get "
"an additional dimension with the RGB color channels by passing "
"``color=True``, in that case the shape will be ``(2200, 2, 62, 47, 3)``."

"The :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs` datasets is subdivided into "
"3 subsets: the development ``train`` set, the development ``test`` set "
"and an evaluation ``10_folds`` set meant to compute performance metrics "
"using a 10-folds cross validation scheme."
