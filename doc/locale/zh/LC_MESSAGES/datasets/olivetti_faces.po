"This dataset contains a set of face images taken between April 1992 and "
"April 1994 at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. The website describing the "
"original dataset is now defunct, but archived copies can be accessed "
"through `the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine`_. The "
":func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces` function is the data "
"fetching / caching function that downloads the data archive from AT&T."

"There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some "
"subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting,"
" facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and "
"facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against "
"a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal "
"position (with tolerance for some side movement)."

"The image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned 8-bit "
"integers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the "
"interval [0, 1], which are easier to work with for many algorithms."

"The \"target\" for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating "
"the identity of the person pictured; however, with only 10 examples per "
"class, this relatively small dataset is more interesting from an "
"unsupervised or semi-supervised perspective."
