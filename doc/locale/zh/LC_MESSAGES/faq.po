"No. As a rule we only add well-established algorithms. A rule of thumb is"

"Code is maintenance cost, and we need to balance the amount of code we "
"have with the size of the team (and add to this the fact that complexity "

"Not in the foreseeable future. scikit-learn tries to provide a unified "
"API for the basic tasks in machine learning, with pipelines and meta-"
"algorithms like grid search to tie everything together. The required "
"concepts, APIs, algorithms and expertise required for structured learning"
" are different from what scikit-learn has to offer. If we started doing "

"`pystruct <http://pystruct.github.io/>`_ handles general structured "

"`seqlearn <http://larsmans.github.io/seqlearn/>`_ handles sequences only "

msgid "Will you add GPU support?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:136
msgid ""
"No, or at least not in the near future. The main reason is that GPU "
"support will introduce many software dependencies and introduce platform "
"specific issues. scikit-learn is designed to be easy to install on a wide"
" variety of platforms. Outside of neural networks, GPUs don't play a "
"large role in machine learning today, and much larger gains in speed can "
"often be achieved by a careful choice of algorithms."

#: ../../faq.rst:146
msgid ""
"In case you didn't know, `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_ is the new, fast, "
"just-in-time compiling Python implementation. We don't support it. When "
"the `NumPy support <http://buildbot.pypy.org/numpy-status/latest.html>`_ "
"in PyPy is complete or near-complete, and SciPy is ported over as well, "
"we can start thinking of a port. We use too much of NumPy to work with a "
"partial implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:154
msgid "How do I deal with string data (or trees, graphs...)?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:156
msgid ""
"scikit-learn estimators assume you'll feed them real-valued feature "
"vectors. This assumption is hard-coded in pretty much all of the library."
" However, you can feed non-numerical inputs to estimators in several "
"ways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:160
msgid ""
"If you have text documents, you can use a term frequency features; see "
":ref:`text_feature_extraction` for the built-in *text vectorizers*. For "
"more general feature extraction from any kind of data, see "
":ref:`dict_feature_extraction` and :ref:`feature_hashing`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:165
msgid ""
"Another common case is when you have non-numerical data and a custom "
"distance (or similarity) metric on these data. Examples include strings "
"with edit distance (aka. Levenshtein distance; e.g., DNA or RNA "
"sequences). These can be encoded as numbers, but doing so is painful and "
"error-prone. Working with distance metrics on arbitrary data can be done "
"in two ways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:171
msgid ""
"Firstly, many estimators take precomputed distance/similarity matrices, "
"so if the dataset is not too large, you can compute distances for all "
"pairs of inputs. If the dataset is large, you can use feature vectors "
"with only one \"feature\", which is an index into a separate data "
"structure, and supply a custom metric function that looks up the actual "
"data in this data structure. E.g., to use DBSCAN with Levenshtein "
"distances::"

"Similar tricks can be used, with some care, for tree kernels, graph "
"kernels, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:201
msgid "Why do I sometime get a crash/freeze with n_jobs > 1 under OSX or Linux?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:203
msgid ""
"Several scikit-learn tools such as ``GridSearchCV`` and "
"``cross_val_score`` rely internally on Python's `multiprocessing` module "
"to parallelize execution onto several Python processes by passing "
"``n_jobs > 1`` as argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:207
msgid ""
"The problem is that Python ``multiprocessing`` does a ``fork`` system "
"call without following it with an ``exec`` system call for performance "
"reasons. Many libraries like (some versions of) Accelerate / vecLib under"
" OSX, (some versions of) MKL, the OpenMP runtime of GCC, nvidia's Cuda "
"(and probably many others), manage their own internal thread pool. Upon a"
" call to `fork`, the thread pool state in the child process is corrupted:"
" the thread pool believes it has many threads while only the main thread "
"state has been forked. It is possible to change the libraries to make "
"them detect when a fork happens and reinitialize the thread pool in that "
"case: we did that for OpenBLAS (merged upstream in master since 0.2.10) "
"and we contributed a `patch "
"<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60035>`_ to GCC's OpenMP "
"runtime (not yet reviewed)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:220
msgid ""
"But in the end the real culprit is Python's ``multiprocessing`` that does"
" ``fork`` without ``exec`` to reduce the overhead of starting and using "
"new Python processes for parallel computing. Unfortunately this is a "
"violation of the POSIX standard and therefore some software editors like "
"Apple refuse to consider the lack of fork-safety in Accelerate / vecLib "
"as a bug."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:226
msgid ""
"In Python 3.4+ it is now possible to configure ``multiprocessing`` to use"
" the 'forkserver' or 'spawn' start methods (instead of the default "
"'fork') to manage the process pools. This makes it possible to not be "
"subject to this issue anymore. The version of joblib shipped with scikit-"
"learn automatically uses that setting by default (under Python 3.4 and "
"later)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:232
msgid ""
"If you have custom code that uses ``multiprocessing`` directly instead of"
" using it via joblib you can enable the the 'forkserver' mode globally "
"for your program: Insert the following instructions in your main script::"
