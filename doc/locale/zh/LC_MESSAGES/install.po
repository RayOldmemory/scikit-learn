"**We don't recommend installing scipy or numpy using pip on linux**, as "
"this will involve a lengthy build-process with many dependencies. Without"
" careful configuration, building numpy yourself can lead to an "
"installation that is much slower than it should be. If you are using "
"Linux, consider using your package manager to install scikit-learn. It is"
" usually the easiest way, but might not provide the newest version. If "
"you haven't already installed numpy and scipy and can't install them via "
"your operation system, it is recommended to use a third party "
