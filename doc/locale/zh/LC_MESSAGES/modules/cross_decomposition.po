"The cross decomposition module contains two main families of algorithms: "
"the partial least squares (PLS) and the canonical correlation analysis "
"(CCA)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../modules/cross_decomposition.rst:12
msgid ""
"These families of algorithms are useful to find linear relations between "
"two multivariate datasets: the ``X`` and ``Y`` arguments of the ``fit`` "
"method are 2D arrays."

"Cross decomposition algorithms find the fundamental relations between two"
" matrices (X and Y). They are latent variable approaches to modeling the "
"covariance structures in these two spaces. They will try to find the "
"multidimensional direction in the X space that explains the maximum "
"multidimensional variance direction in the Y space. PLS-regression is "
"particularly suited when the matrix of predictors has more variables than"
" observations, and when there is multicollinearity among X values. By "
"contrast, standard regression will fail in these cases."
