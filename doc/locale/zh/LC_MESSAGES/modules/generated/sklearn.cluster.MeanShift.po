msgid "Mean shift clustering using a flat kernel."
msgstr ""

#: :5
msgid ""
"Mean shift clustering aims to discover \"blobs\" in a smooth density of "
"samples. It is a centroid-based algorithm, which works by updating "
"candidates for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given "
"region. These candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to "
"eliminate near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids."

#: :34
msgid ""
"If true, initial kernel locations are not locations of all points, but "
"rather the location of the discretized version of points, where points "
"are binned onto a grid whose coarseness corresponds to the bandwidth. "
"Setting this option to True will speed up the algorithm because fewer "
"seeds will be initialized. default value: False Ignored if seeds argument"
" is not None."

msgid "Scalability:"
msgstr ""

#: :77
msgid ""
"Because this implementation uses a flat kernel and a Ball Tree to look up"
" members of each kernel, the complexity will is to O(T*n*log(n)) in lower"
" dimensions, with n the number of samples and T the number of points. In "
"higher dimensions the complexity will tend towards O(T*n^2)."
msgstr ""

#: :83
msgid ""
"Scalability can be boosted by using fewer seeds, for example by using a "
"higher value of min_bin_freq in the get_bin_seeds function."
msgstr ""

#: :86
msgid ""
"Note that the estimate_bandwidth function is much less scalable than the "
"mean shift algorithm and will be the bottleneck if it is used."
