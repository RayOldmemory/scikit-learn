"In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of the "
"individual clusters is highly non-convex or more generally when a measure"
" of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable description of"
" the complete cluster. For instance when clusters are nested circles on "
"the 2D plan."
