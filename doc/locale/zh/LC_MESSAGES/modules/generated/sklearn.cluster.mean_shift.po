"If bandwidth is not given, it is determined using a heuristic based on "
"the median of all pairwise distances. This will take quadratic time in "
"the number of samples. The sklearn.cluster.estimate_bandwidth function "

"If true, initial kernel locations are not locations of all points, but "
"rather the location of the discretized version of points, where points "
"are binned onto a grid whose coarseness corresponds to the bandwidth. "
"Setting this option to True will speed up the algorithm because fewer "
