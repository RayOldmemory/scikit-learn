#: :5
msgid ""
"Provides randomized train/test indices to split data according to a "
"third-party provided label. This label information can be used to encode "
"arbitrary domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers."
msgstr ""

#: :9
msgid ""
"For instance the labels could be the year of collection of the samples "
"and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits."
msgstr ""

#: :12
msgid ""
"The difference between LeavePLabelOut and LabelShuffleSplit is that the "
"former generates splits using all subsets of size ``p`` unique labels, "
"whereas LabelShuffleSplit generates a user-determined number of random "
"test splits, each with a user-determined fraction of unique labels."
msgstr ""

#: :17
msgid ""
"For example, a less computationally intensive alternative to "
"``LeavePLabelOut(labels, p=10)`` would be ``LabelShuffleSplit(labels, "
"test_size=10, n_iter=100)``."

#: :21
msgid ""
"Note: The parameters ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` refer to labels, "
"and not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit."

"If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of "
