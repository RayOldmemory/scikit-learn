"Provides train/test indices to split data according to a third-party "
"provided label. This label information can be used to encode arbitrary "
"domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers."

"For instance the labels could be the year of collection of the samples "
"and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits."

#: :12

"The difference between LeavePLabelOut and LeaveOneLabelOut is that the "
"former builds the test sets with all the samples assigned to ``p`` "
"different values of the labels while the latter uses samples all assigned"
" the same labels."
