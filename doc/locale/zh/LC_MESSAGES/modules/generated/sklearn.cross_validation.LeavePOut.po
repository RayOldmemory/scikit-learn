"Provides train/test indices to split data in train test sets. This "
"results in testing on all distinct samples of size p, while the remaining"
" n - p samples form the training set in each iteration."

"Note: ``LeavePOut(n, p)`` is NOT equivalent to ``KFold(n, n_folds=n // "
"p)`` which creates non-overlapping test sets."

"Due to the high number of iterations which grows combinatorically with "
"the number of samples this cross validation method can be very costly. "
"For large datasets one should favor KFold, StratifiedKFold or "
"ShuffleSplit."
