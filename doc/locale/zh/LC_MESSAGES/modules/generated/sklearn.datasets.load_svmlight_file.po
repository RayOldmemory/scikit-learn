"This format is a text-based format, with one sample per line. It does not"
" store zero valued features hence is suitable for sparse dataset."

"The first element of each line can be used to store a target variable to "
"predict."

"This format is used as the default format for both svmlight and the "
"libsvm command line programs."

msgid ""
"Parsing a text based source can be expensive. When working on repeatedly "
"on the same dataset, it is recommended to wrap this loader with "
"joblib.Memory.cache to store a memmapped backup of the CSR results of the"
" first call and benefit from the near instantaneous loading of memmapped "
"structures for the subsequent calls."

#: :20
msgid ""
"In case the file contains a pairwise preference constraint (known as "
"\"qid\" in the svmlight format) these are ignored unless the query_id "
"parameter is set to True. These pairwise preference constraints can be "
"used to constraint the combination of samples when using pairwise loss "
"functions (as is the case in some learning to rank problems) so that only"
" pairs with the same query_id value are considered."

"(Path to) a file to load. If a path ends in \".gz\" or \".bz2\", it will "

"The number of features to use. If None, it will be inferred. This "

"Whether column indices in f are zero-based (True) or one-based (False). "
