"This function is equivalent to mapping load_svmlight_file over a list of "
"files, except that the results are concatenated into a single, flat list "
"and the samples vectors are constrained to all have the same number of "
"features."

#: :10
msgid ""
"In case the file contains a pairwise preference constraint (known as "
"\"qid\" in the svmlight format) these are ignored unless the query_id "
"parameter is set to True. These pairwise preference constraints can be "
"used to constraint the combination of samples when using pairwise loss "
"functions (as is the case in some learning to rank problems) so that only"
" pairs with the same query_id value are considered."

"be uncompressed on the fly. If an integer is passed, it is assumed to be "
"a file descriptor. File-likes and file descriptors will not be closed by "

"This can be set to a higher value than the actual number of features in "
"any of the input files, but setting it to a lower value will cause an "

"Using \"auto\" or True should always be safe."

"When fitting a model to a matrix X_train and evaluating it against a "
"matrix X_test, it is essential that X_train and X_test have the same "
"number of features (X_train.shape[1] == X_test.shape[1]). This may not be"
" the case if you load the files individually with load_svmlight_file."
