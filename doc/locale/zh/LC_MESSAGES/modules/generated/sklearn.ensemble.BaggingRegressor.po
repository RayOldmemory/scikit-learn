"A Bagging regressor is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base "
"regressors each on random subsets of the original dataset and then "
"aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging)"
" to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used "
"as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a "
"decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction "
"procedure and then making an ensemble out of it."

"This algorithm encompasses several works from the literature. When random"
" subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the samples, then "
"this algorithm is known as Pasting [R15]_. If samples are drawn with "
"replacement, then the method is known as Bagging [R16]_. When random "
"subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then "
"the method is known as Random Subspaces [R17]_. Finally, when base "
"estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the "
"method is known as Random Patches [R18]_."
