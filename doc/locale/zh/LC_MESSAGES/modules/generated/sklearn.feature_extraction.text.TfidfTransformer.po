"Tf means term-frequency while tf-idf means term-frequency times inverse "
"document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information"
" retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification."
msgstr ""

#: :9
msgid ""
"The goal of using tf-idf instead of the raw frequencies of occurrence of "
"a token in a given document is to scale down the impact of tokens that "
"occur very frequently in a given corpus and that are hence empirically "
"less informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the "
"training corpus."
msgstr ""

#: :15
msgid ""
"The actual formula used for tf-idf is tf * (idf + 1) = tf + tf * idf, "
"instead of tf * idf. The effect of this is that terms with zero idf, i.e."
" that occur in all documents of a training set, will not be entirely "
"ignored. The formulas used to compute tf and idf depend on parameter "
"settings that correspond to the SMART notation used in IR, as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: :21
msgid ""
"Tf is \"n\" (natural) by default, \"l\" (logarithmic) when "
"sublinear_tf=True. Idf is \"t\" when use_idf is given, \"n\" (none) "
"otherwise. Normalization is \"c\" (cosine) when norm='l2', \"n\" (none) "
"when norm=None."
