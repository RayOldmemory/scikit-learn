msgid ""
"Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the "
"coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature "
"elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering "
"smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on "
"the initial set of features and weights are assigned to each one of them."
" Then, features whose absolute weights are the smallest are pruned from "
"the current set features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the "
"pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually "
"reached."
