"This score can be used to select the n_features features with the highest"
" values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must contain "

"Recall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic "
"variables, so using this function \"weeds out\" the features that are the"
" most likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for "
