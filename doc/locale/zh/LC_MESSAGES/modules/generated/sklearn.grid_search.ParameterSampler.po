"Non-deterministic iterable over random candidate combinations for hyper- "
"parameter search. If all parameters are presented as a list, sampling "
"without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter is given as a"
" distribution, sampling with replacement is used. It is highly "
"recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous parameters."

"Note that as of SciPy 0.12, the ``scipy.stats.distributions`` do not "
"accept a custom RNG instance and always use the singleton RNG from "
"``numpy.random``. Hence setting ``random_state`` will not guarantee a "
"deterministic iteration whenever ``scipy.stats`` distributions are used "
"to define the parameter search space."
