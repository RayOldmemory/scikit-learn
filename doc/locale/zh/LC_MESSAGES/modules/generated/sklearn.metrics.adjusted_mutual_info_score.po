"Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) is an adjustment of the Mutual "
"Information (MI) score to account for chance. It accounts for the fact "
"that the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number "
"of clusters, regardless of whether there is actually more information "
"shared. For two clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V`, the AMI is given "
"as::"

"This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels: a "
"permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the score "
"value in any way."

#: :17

"This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with "
"``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to "
"measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies on "
"the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known."

"The AMI returns a value of 1 when the two partitions are identical (ie "
