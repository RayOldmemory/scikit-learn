"considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in "
"the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings."

"The raw RI score is then \"adjusted for chance\" into the ARI score using"
" the following scheme::"

"The adjusted Rand index is thus ensured to have a value close to 0.0 for "
"random labeling independently of the number of clusters and samples and "
