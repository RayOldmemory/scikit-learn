"Across all items in a set N predictions, the Brier score measures the "
"mean squared difference between (1) the predicted probability assigned to"
" the possible outcomes for item i, and (2) the actual outcome. Therefore,"
" the lower the Brier score is for a set of predictions, the better the "
"predictions are calibrated. Note that the Brier score always takes on a "
"value between zero and one, since this is the largest possible difference"
" between a predicted probability (which must be between zero and one) and"
" the actual outcome (which can take on values of only 0 and 1)."

"The Brier score is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that "
"can be structured as true or false, but is inappropriate for ordinal "
"variables which can take on three or more values (this is because the "
"Brier score assumes that all possible outcomes are equivalently "
"\"distant\" from one another). Which label is considered to be the "
"positive label is controlled via the parameter pos_label, which defaults "
"to 1."
