"In binary class case, assuming labels in y_true are encoded with +1 and "
"-1, when a prediction mistake is made, ``margin = y_true * "
"pred_decision`` is always negative (since the signs disagree), implying "
"``1 - margin`` is always greater than 1.  The cumulated hinge loss is "
"therefore an upper bound of the number of mistakes made by the "
"classifier."

#: :11

"In multiclass case, the function expects that either all the labels are "
"included in y_true or an optional labels argument is provided which "
"contains all the labels. The multilabel margin is calculated according to"
" Crammer-Singer's method. As in the binary case, the cumulated hinge loss"
" is an upper bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier."
