"The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a "
"measure of the quality of binary (two-class) classifications. It takes "
"into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally "
"regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are "
"of very different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient "
"value between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect "
"prediction, 0 an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction."
"  The statistic is also known as the phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]"
