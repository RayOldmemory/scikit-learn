"The Mutual Information is a measure of the similarity between two labels "
"of the same data. Where :math:`P(i)` is the probability of a random "
"sample occurring in cluster :math:`U_i` and :math:`P'(j)` is the "
"probability of a random sample occurring in cluster :math:`V_j`, the "
"Mutual Information between clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V` is given "

"This is equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the joint "

"This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels: a "
"permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the score "
"value in any way."

"This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with "
"``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to "
"measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies on "
"the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known."
