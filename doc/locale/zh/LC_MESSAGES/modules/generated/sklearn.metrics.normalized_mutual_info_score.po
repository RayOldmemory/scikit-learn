"Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is an normalization of the Mutual "
"Information (MI) score to scale the results between 0 (no mutual "
"information) and 1 (perfect correlation). In this function, mutual "
"information is normalized by ``sqrt(H(labels_true) * H(labels_pred))``"

"This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels: a "
"permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the score "
"value in any way."

#: :17

"This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with "
"``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to "
"measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies on "
"the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known."
