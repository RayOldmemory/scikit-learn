"This formulation has two advantages over other ways of computing "
"distances. First, it is computationally efficient when dealing with "
"sparse data. Second, if one argument varies but the other remains "
"unchanged, then `dot(x, x)` and/or `dot(y, y)` can be pre-computed."

"However, this is not the most precise way of doing this computation, and "
"the distance matrix returned by this function may not be exactly "
"symmetric as required by, e.g., ``scipy.spatial.distance`` functions."
