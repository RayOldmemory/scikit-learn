"The metric to use when calculating kernel between instances in a feature "

"assumed to be a kernel matrix. Alternatively, if metric is a callable "
"function, it is called on each pair of instances (rows) and the resulting"
" value recorded. The callable should take two arrays from X as input and "
"return a value indicating the distance between them."
