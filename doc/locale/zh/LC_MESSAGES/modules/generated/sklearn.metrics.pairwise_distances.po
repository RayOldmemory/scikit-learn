"This method takes either a vector array or a distance matrix, and returns"
" a distance matrix. If the input is a vector array, the distances are "
"computed. If the input is a distances matrix, it is returned instead."

"This method provides a safe way to take a distance matrix as input, while"
" preserving compatibility with many other algorithms that take a vector "
"array."

"Note that in the case of 'cityblock', 'cosine' and 'euclidean' (which are"
" valid scipy.spatial.distance metrics), the scikit-learn implementation "
"will be used, which is faster and has support for sparse matrices (except"

"\"precomputed\", X is assumed to be a distance matrix. Alternatively, if "
"metric is a callable function, it is called on each pair of instances "
"(rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable should take two "
"arrays from X as input and return a value indicating the distance between"
