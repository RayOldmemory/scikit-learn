"The Silhouette Coefficient is a measure of how well samples are clustered"
" with samples that are similar to themselves. Clustering models with a "
"high Silhouette Coefficient are said to be dense, where samples in the "
"same cluster are similar to each other, and well separated, where samples"
" in different clusters are not very similar to each other."

"The Silhouette Coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster "
"distance (``a``) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (``b``) for each "
"sample.  The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is ``(b - a) / max(a, "
"b)``. Note that Silhouette Coefficent is only defined if number of labels"
" is 2 <= n_labels <= n_samples - 1."
