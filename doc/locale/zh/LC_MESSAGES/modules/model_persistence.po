"After training a scikit-learn model, it is desirable to have a way to "
"persist the model for future use without having to retrain. The following"
" section gives you an example of how to persist a model with pickle. "
"We'll also review a few security and maintainability issues when working "
"with pickle serialization."

"In the specific case of the scikit, it may be more interesting to use "
"joblib's replacement of pickle (``joblib.dump`` & ``joblib.load``), which"
" is more efficient on objects that carry large numpy arrays internally as"
" is often the case for fitted scikit-learn estimators, but can only "
"pickle to the disk and not to a string::"

"joblib.dump returns a list of filenames. Each individual numpy array "
