"`Machine learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_ is a "
"technique with a growing importance, as the size of the datasets "
"experimental sciences are facing is rapidly growing. Problems it tackles "
"range from building a prediction function linking different observations,"
" to classifying observations, or learning the structure in an unlabeled "
"dataset."
